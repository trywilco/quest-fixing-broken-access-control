title: Fixing Broken Access Controls
subtitle: "Secure user data: Restrict item deletion to item creators alone"
description: In this quest, you'll be addressing a critical problem that has led
  to some Anythink users losing their items comments. We suspect our delete comment endpoint
  is being exploited. Your mission is to identify if there is indeed a problem,
  find out what the API call to delete a comment is, verify who can delete comment,
  and fix any broken access controls.
summary: Nice work! You learned how to identify and fix broken access controls.
  You ensured our delete comment endpoint can only be accessed by the comment's
  author. This adventure led you to inspect API calls, verify access rules,
  and make necessary changes via a PR.
